## Matplotlib 

Matplotlib is a python library for generating appealing plots that are ready to go into your presentations/articles. <br>
I used it extensively during my PhD and postdocs and keep returning to it as I explore data science. <br>
I hope I can sell it to you (*if* you don't use it already, that is) with a simple plot. Here -

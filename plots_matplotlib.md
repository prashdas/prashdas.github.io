## Matplotlib 

Matplotlib is a python library for generating appealing plots that are ready to go into your presentations/articles. I used it extensively during my PhD and postdocs and keep returning to it as I work on data science / ML projects. I hope I can sell it to you (*if you don't use it already, that is*) with a sample plot.

This is a plot of an experimentally measured velocity field of a two-dimensional starting jet. The two thick black lines represent bendable flaps that move and deform based on the fluid forces. The plot shows streamlines of the velocity field which are laid on top of the colored contours of velocity magnitude. Now, it is clear from the swirling streamlines that there are at least two large vortices in the flow. 

I was impressed when I first came across matplotlib (or Python for that matter). As a novice grad student I would laboriously make plots and implement changes using different gui based plotting software. Sure, there was MATLAB to take care of programming needs, but I could never take work 'home', because of reasons I wouldn't want to delve in here. I realized running Python on my mediocre-performance laptop was the thing that I needed in my life. Moreover, if you are comfortable running MATLAB, this won't be a big transition. And the last thing, of course, I personally find the plots generated by matplotlib to be more visually appealing. 

The data required to plot these streamlines and velocity contours are in the form of a matrix organized as [x, y, u, v]. Here x,y are the Cartesian coordinates and u,v are the two corresponding components of velocity. 

```
# First we import the required libraries - 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.interpolate import griddata

# Then we load the file and variables -
file_name = 'Velocity_field.dat'
x,y,u,v = np.loadtxt(file_name, usecols=(0,1,2,3), unpack=True)

# Some basic processing to set boundaries etc.
xmin=round(x.min());  xmax=round(x.max());  ymin=round(y.min());  ymax=round(y.max());
```

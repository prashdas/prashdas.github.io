## Matplotlib 

Matplotlib is a python library for generating appealing plots that are ready to go into your presentations/articles. <br>
I used it extensively during my PhD and postdocs and keep returning to it as I explore data science. <br>
I hope I can sell it to you (*if you don't use it already, that is*) with a simple plot. Here -

I was very impressed when I first came across matplotlib (or Python for that matter). As a novice grad student I would laboriously make plots and implement changes using different gui based plotting software. Sure, there was MATLAB to take care of programming needs, but I could never take work 'home', so to speak. Due to reasons I wouldn't want to delve in here, I realized running Python on my mediocre-performance laptop was the thing that I needed in my life.
